## Getting Started
Just follow the links to the "add trails" section. Add your trail name, length, diffficulty, points of interest and custom notes.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, users will be able to locate hinking trails near them. We will also be building in functionality for walks in cities and towns that take the user past known points of interest. We will also be utilizing rivers to map out drop off and pick up locations for kayakers, supp and canoers!
